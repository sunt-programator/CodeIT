> **CodeIT** is a **clean**, **elegant** but **advanced** blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It is based on the original [LoveIt Theme](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt), [LeaveIt Theme](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt), and [KeepIt Theme](https://github.com/Fastbyte01/KeepIt).

Since the three themes have a similar look, if you have questions about their differences,
read [Why to choose CodeIT](#why-choose-CodeIT) so that you can choose the one that works best for you.

## [Demo Site](https://codeit.suntprogramator.dev/)

To see this theme in action, here is a live [demo site](https://codeit.suntprogramator.dev/) that is rendered with the **CodeIT** theme.

Compared to the original LeaveIt theme and the KeepIt theme, the CodeIT theme has the following modifications.

- Custom **Header**
- Custom **CSS Style**
- A new **home page**, compatible with the latest version of Hugo
- A lot of **style detail adjustments,** including color, font size, margins, code preview style
- More readable **dark mode**
- Some beautiful **CSS animations**
- Easy-to-use and self-expanding **table of contents**
- More **social links**, **share sites**, and **comment system**
- **Search** supported by [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) or [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)
- **Copy code** to the clipboard with one click
- Extended Markdown syntax for **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons**
- Extended Markdown syntax for **ruby annotation**
- Extended Markdown syntax for **fractions**
- **Mathematical formula** supported by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)

if you prefer the design language and freedom of the CodeIT theme,
if you want to use the extended Font Awesome icons conveniently,
if you want to embed mathematical formulas, flowcharts, music, or Bilibili videos in your posts,
the CodeIT theme may be more suitable for you.

I hope you will CodeIT üë©‚Äçüíª!

## Add the theme to your blog

First, download the theme from GitHub and add it to your site‚Äôs themes directory:

```bash
cd your-hugo-blog-directory
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/sunt-programator/CodeIT.git themes/CodeIT
```

_Note for non-git users:_

If you do not have git installed, you can download the archive of the latest version of this theme from the [release page](https://github.com/sunt-programator/CodeIT/releases) of this repository.

Extract the `.zip` file to get a `CodeIT-latest` directory.
Rename that directory to `CodeIT`, and move it into the `themes/` directory.
Then, add the theme to the site configuration:

```bash
echo 'theme = "CodeIT"' >> config.toml
```

## [Build documentation instructions](https://codeit.suntprogramator.dev/categories/documentation/)

You can build the theme documentation locally by using a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) or by manually install the [`Hugo`](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).
The main advantage of the `devcontainer` is that you will have a preconfigured container with all tools required for developing and building the theme documentation.

```bash
hugo server --source=exampleSite
```
